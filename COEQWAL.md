# Executive Summary

Water is essential to life, yet its allocation in California has long been shaped by power and privilege, leaving marginalized communities with limited access to clean, affordable, and sustainable water supplies. Historically, key decisions about water distribution have been made behind closed doors, relying on complex models and datasets that remain inaccessible to the very communities most affected by water scarcity, contamination, and climate change. COllaboratory for EQuity in Water ALlocations (COEQWAL) is working to change that by democratizing water decision-making, breaking down barriers to access, and ensuring that communities historically left out of water governance can fully participate in shaping their water future.

At its core, COEQWAL is about opening up the water allocation decision-making process by providing communities with access to the models, data, and tools that influence policy. By making these technical resources transparent and user-friendly, COEQWAL ensures that historically excluded groups—including Indigenous communities, low-income rural residents, and environmental justice advocates—can engage with the same scientific tools used by government agencies and water managers. This initiative does not just provide information; it empowers communities to advocate for fairer water policies, challenge inequitable decisions, and co-develop solutions that work for them.

COEQWAL’s Equity Framework addresses water justice through four key dimensions:

*   **Structural Equity**, which seeks to dismantle historical injustices embedded in water laws, infrastructure, and governance.
*   **Recognitional & Cultural Equity**, ensuring that Indigenous knowledge and historically excluded perspectives are valued in decision-making.
*   **Procedural Equity**, making decision-making processes inclusive, transparent, and accessible to all.
*   **Distributional Equity**, ensuring that water resources are allocated in a way that prioritizes those who need them most, rather than reinforcing existing disparities.

By embedding these principles into its approach, COEQWAL aims to transform how water is governed—not just by redistributing resources more fairly, but by redistributing access to decision-making power itself. Through data transparency, participatory modeling, and community engagement, COEQWAL gives communities the tools to understand, interpret, and influence the policies that affect their water security. A critical component of COEQWAL’s work is applying justice-based frameworks to evaluate and improve water allocation policies. These frameworks include:

*   **Needs-Based Equity**, prioritizing essential water uses like drinking and sanitation for underserved communities.
*   **Burden-Sharing Equity**, ensuring that conservation costs do not disproportionately fall on marginalized groups.
*   **Spatial Equity**, addressing geographic disparities in water access and infrastructure investment.
*   **Reparational Equity**, correcting historical injustices by restoring water rights to Indigenous and excluded communities.
*   **Intergenerational Equity**, ensuring today’s decisions do not compromise water access for future generations.

COEQWAL is not creating new decision-making structures—it is opening up existing ones. By providing transparent, community-accessible data and modeling tools, it allows those most affected by water policies to understand allocation trade-offs, challenge inequitable policies, and co-develop more just and sustainable solutions. Key focus areas include:

*   Ensuring access to safe and affordable drinking water, particularly in communities facing contamination or financial barriers.
*   Balancing human water needs with environmental sustainability, protecting ecosystems while ensuring communities have the water they need to thrive.
*   Developing equitable drought response strategies, ensuring that water shortages and restrictions do not disproportionately harm marginalized communities.
*   Integrating Indigenous water stewardship practices, recognizing and incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into modern water planning.

COEQWAL aligns with California’s broader racial equity and climate resilience commitments, reinforcing efforts to center environmental justice in water governance. Through collaboration, transparency, and knowledge-sharing, COEQWAL ensures that water governance is not controlled by a select few but is shaped by the voices of those most impacted. By democratizing access to models, data, and decision-making tools, COEQWAL is creating a future where communities do not just receive water decisions—they help make them. Through this approach, COEQWAL is not just addressing water inequities but reshaping the very process through which water is governed in California, ensuring that every community has the knowledge, tools, and power to secure a just and sustainable water future.

# 1 Introduction

---

California’s water allocation system is highly complex, shaped by diverse stakeholders, legal frameworks, and varying local conditions. However, these allocations have historically been inequitable, disproportionately benefiting certain groups while damaging the health of ecosystems and leaving marginalized communities with inadequate access to clean and reliable water. These disparities will be further exacerbated by climate change, necessitating urgent reforms. The COllaboratory for EQuity in Water ALlocations (COEQWAL) was created to address these challenges by building new human networks and information resources that promote inclusive and sustainable water stewardship in an era of climate change. At its core, COEQWAL integrates equity into climate resilience planning, recognizing that just and sustainable water management is inseparable from the well-being of vulnerable communities and the environment. As climate change exacerbates water scarcity, flooding, and ecosystem disruptions, marginalized communities bear the heaviest burden. By providing data about possible future climate and allocations of water, COEQWAL provides data that can inform strategies to correct these disparities. The project aims to ensure that resilience-building efforts do not reinforce existing inequities but instead create a more just water future for all.

Water allocation decisions often rely on models that consider a limited range of climate and operational scenarios, are constrained by entrenched water rights, and remain largely inaccessible to the public. COEQWAL seeks to transform this landscape by launching a user-driven framework for water planning that builds on existing models used to operate California’s major water supply systems. This initiative empowers historically excluded end-users by expanding access to water modeling tools, data, and decision-making processes. The COEQWAL equity framework ensures that equity is embedded at every stage of integrated water modeling, from scenario development to interpretation and policy decisions. Climate resilience and social resilience are deeply interconnected: a truly resilient water system must serve both people and ecosystems equitably, ensuring clean water access while supporting long-term environmental sustainability.

## 1.1 Community Engagement Approach

Central to COEQWAL's mission is a robust community engagement strategy designed to ensure that diverse perspectives inform project planning, implementation and output. We have formed several advisory groups to shape the project, including a:

*   **Steering Committee:** Comprising representatives from various stakeholder groups, the Steering Committee provides strategic direction and oversight, ensuring that the project's goals align with community needs and priorities.
*   **Advisory Cohort:** This group brings together individuals with expertise in areas such as environmental justice, Indigenous water rights, and public policy, as well as representatives from water interests and regions throughout the state, to offer guidance and insights throughout the project's development.
*   **Use Case Advisory Committees:** Focused on specific water management issues of concern, these committees engage local communities and experts to co-develop practical solutions tailored to unique regional or sectoral challenges (salmon recovery, affordable drinking water, environmental flows, and just transitions salinity Bay Delta).

By integrating these collaborative structures, COEQWAL aims to center the lived experiences and expertise of California's diverse communities, fostering a more equitable and resilient water future.

## 1.2 COEQWAL's Approach to Equity

At its core, COEQWAL recognizes that equity is about fairness, rights, and justice—ensuring that all people, regardless of background, location, or historical disadvantages, have access to the resources and opportunities needed to thrive. Unlike equality, which assumes that the same treatment will yield the same results, equity acknowledges historical and systemic disparities. In the context of water, this means recognizing past injustices, addressing current vulnerabilities, and ensuring that future policies and infrastructure support those most affected by climate change and environmental degradation (see Figure 1).

[Image: Figure 1. What is the difference between equality and equity? (Source: ???)]

According toWilder & Ingram (2016):

> *"Water equity is malleable in that it is subject to the context in which it exists and people's perceptions, which differ both spatially and temporally."*

Higgs and Meissner (2024) further emphasize:

> *"Water equity is an iterative and continuous process. It is simultaneously both a process and an outcome."*

This perspective recognizes that efforts to enhance equity is an ongoing, evolving process rather than a fixed destination. This avoids the challenge of finding a single ‘perfect’ solution and instead frames equity as a process that must be measured, redefined, and refined over time. COEQWAL seeks to advance equity by defining and measuring progress across multiple dimensions, including: distributional, procedural, recognitional, and structural equity.

These dimensions are interconnected and are analogous to a tree[^1], in which distributional equity serves as the crown, procedural equity as the trunk, recognitional equity as the root system, and structural equity as the tree’s environment and soil. The dimensions of equity and the parts of a tree, as well as its environment, impact the other dimensions and parts, respectively, and contribute to the functioning of the whole. Working to improve equity across a single dimension does not guarantee that equity across the other dimensions will improve, just as tending to the leaves or branches of a tree would not guarantee that the root system is able to absorb enough nutrients from the soil. Structural equity is like the tree’s environment—interconnected, dynamic, and mutually influential.

[Image: Figure 2. Recognitional, procedural, distributional and structural equity (Source: Seigerman et al. 2023)]

COEQWAL advances **structural equity** by increasing transparency in water systems and providing modeling tools to those lacking resources for legal or technical advocacy. Many wealthier organizations can afford water modelers and legal expertise, while historically marginalized groups cannot. Water board officials emphasize that data is key to advocacy—COEQWAL helps bridge this gap. See section XX for more information.

COEQWAL addresses **recognitional equity** in several ways. First, project communications and information resources are designed to be as accessible as possible to diverse audiences. A project science communication specialist leads efforts to create communication materials that are accessible to different audiences. Second, we recognize, and will take protective steps to engage, a broad diversity of publics that have a stake in California’s water future. In particular, we recognize that overcoming historical marginalization may require greater representation and voice from groups experiencing that marginalization as compared to others. We work to ensure that community groups that have been historically marginalized or excluded from water decision making have equitable representation and a voice in our project. Third, we provide opportunities for community partners to share their experiences, values, preferences, and concerns about water. By providing space for these conversations, the COEQWAL team learns from community partners and use this understanding to responsively shape project activities and products. Finally, we plan to translate key communication products and our project website into Spanish (and other languages as possible) to make the project accessible to a broader audience. See section XX for more information.

In the COEQWAL project, we advance **procedural equity** through inclusive involvement in the project planning and implementation process. This entails making transparent how the COEQWAL project is structured, its goals and constraints, and the manner in which project-specific decisions are made, and engagement processes are organized. Community partners involved in the project will steer how their perspectives and feedback is documented and incorporated in the project process and execution. See section XX for more information.

COEQWAL addresses **distributional equity** in two ways. One concerns whether this project benefits community partners in an equitable manner. By addressing key aspects of recognitional and procedural equity in the project, the benefits of participation and outcomes of the COEQWAL project should be distributed equitably among participating community patterns. For example, all water users independent of their prior experience with water management and planning should have the ability to use and interpret water future scenarios provided by the project. The second way in which COEQWAL addresses distributional equity relates to the actual allocation of water and water-related benefits among recipients, as represented by the systems operations models. Here, COEQWAL is specifically seeking to evaluate the degree to which water is equitably distributed among water users across various scenarios. Recognizing that there are many different conceptions of what is fair and equitably, we consider distributional equity through multiple lenses. See section XX for more information.

## 1.3 Aligning with State Commitments

COEQWAL’s equity framework aligns with California’s water equity commitments as outlined by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), Department of Water Resources (DWR), and other policy directives. For example, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), have publicly acknowledged their role in both creating and addressing water inequities. [DWR’s 2023 Water Plan](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/California-Water-Plan/Docs/Update2023/Final/California-Water-Plan-Update-2023.pdf) Update explicitly recognizes that:

> *"Access to safe, clean water is a fundamental human right, but not all Californians have secure access to this essential resource."*

This update weaves equity throughout the document and dedicates a full chapter to this very important topic. Addressing these equity challenges is crucial for climate adaptation and community resilience for all who live in California and is in accordance with Governor Newsom’s Executive Order N-16-22 which directs State agencies to take critical actions and address equity in all strategic plans and updates.

Additionally, the [State Water Resources Control Board’s 2021 Racial Equity Resolution](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf) acknowledges that:

> *"Historically, the Water Boards’ programs were established over a structural framework that perpetuated inequities based on race. These inequities persist, and prior to this resolution, the Water Boards had not explicitly acknowledged the role racism has played in creating inequities in affordability and access to clean and safe water and in the allocation and protection of water resources."*

The [DWR’s Racial Equity Action Plan](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/About/Files/DWR-REAP-06142022-FINAL_ay11.pdf) also states:

> *"Awareness is not enough. We cannot ignore our collective responsibility to do better with concrete actions, more accountability, and greater transparency."*

The need to address structural inequities is recognized by state agencies. The SWRCB Racial Equity Resolution (2021) acknowledges that past policies disproportionately impacted disadvantaged communities, limiting their access to clean and affordable water. The DWR Water Plan (2023) calls for embedding equity into water policies to correct historical injustices and prevent further disparities. COEQWAL’s work supports these goals by making water system data accessible to communities traditionally excluded from decision-making.

State agencies also emphasize the importance of recognitional equity. For example, the DWR Racial Equity Action Plan stresses that government agencies must engage impacted communities in decision-making, rather than simply informing them. As another example, [California’s CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) tool identifies communities disproportionately affected by environmental and social vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for tailored outreach and engagement. COEQWAL aligns with these commitments by ensuring representation and culturally relevant communication in water governance.

State agencies also draw attention to procedural equity concerns. For example, the DWR Racial Equity Action Plan advocates for community-led engagement and removing barriers to participation and the State Water Plan (2023) calls for equitable decision-making structures that include diverse stakeholders. COEQWAL’s approach supports this by actively incorporating community perspectives into project execution.

Finally, there is also alignment with COEQWAL’s goals and the state’s commitments to distributional equity, such as the State Water Board’s Racial Equity Resolution (2021) and DWR’s Water Plan (2023) that emphasizes the need to prioritize historically disadvantaged communities in water investments. COEQWAL supports these efforts by providing data-driven insights into how water allocation impacts marginalized communities.

# 2 Structural Equity: Recognizing Systemic Barriers to Water Access

---

## 2.1 Structural Equity Dimension

| Structural Inequity: | The systemic barriers that prevent equitable access to water, including historic disenfranchisement, discriminatory water rights laws, and unequal infrastructure investments. |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Objective:** | Recognize the root causes of inequitable water access and distribution, including historical injustices, legal frameworks, and institutional practices that perpetuate disparities. |

California’s water management system has long been shaped by intersecting power dynamics and policies that concentrated access to and control over water, and exacerbated inequities among water users. These inequities are deeply embedded in the state’s water rights, and are entrenched and exacerbated by built infrastructure. Climate change will make these inequities even worse as those with resources – time, power, money, data, etc. – navigate complexity and uncertainty in ways others cannot. **COEQWAL does not directly improve the structural equity in California water management.** Rather, the project recognizes the multitude of ways in which inequities are structurally embedded in water allocations and, by providing tools and data that are accessible to a broader audience, aims to empower communities to advocate for a more equitable water future.

## 2.2 A foundation for structural inequities in 19th century water rights

Indigenous communities lived in California for perhaps 10,000 years, adapting to seasonal cycles and maintaining sustainable practices such as salmon-centric lifestyles in the North or dryland farming in Southern California ([Achieving Water Justice](https://climateandcommunity.org/research/achieving-water-justice-in-california/)). With the arrival of non-indigenous immigrants prior to the 1800s from the U.S., Europe, and East Asia, California’s Indigenous peoples were subjected to displacement, violence, systematic exploitation, and disenfranchisement. In particular, the 1850 “Act for the Government and Protection of Indians” facilitated the forced removal of Indigenous Peoples from their lands, banned cultural practices, and introduced forced labor practices that marginalized these communities ([Newsom apology](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/06/18/governor-newsom-issues-apology-to-native-americans-for-states-historical-wrongdoings-establishes-truth-and-healing-council/)). Private militia campaigns to kill and displace Indigenous Peoples were funded by the State from 1850 to 1859 ([Newsom apology](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/06/18/governor-newsom-issues-apology-to-native-americans-for-states-historical-wrongdoings-establishes-truth-and-healing-council/)). While Indigenous Peoples survived and continued their cultural and religious practices that were oppressed by settlers, the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples from the social and political development of California created structural barriers to the right to water that persists to this day.

During the California Gold Rush, water became a commodity controlled primarily by white miners. The state’s appropriative rights system allowed those who accessed water first to claim priority (i.e. “first in time, first in right”)([Littleworth & Garner](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/212470?ln=en)). This rights system favored senior water rights holders, often wealthy landowners, and penalized junior rights holders and those without water rights at all—typically communities with less power or resources ([California Water Boards](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/2024/2024-04-22-fact-sheet-wr-101.pdf)). This Pre-1914 Water Rights system, along with the displacement of Indigenous people, entrenched an inequitable distribution of water contributed to the loss of Indigenous food sources and ways of life ([Plachta](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-29/rice-farmers-water-rights-drought-california), [SWB 2021](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)). At the same time, nearly two million white settlers received land titles under the Homestead Act and Desert Land Act ([Bork and Ziaja, 2023](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4721938)), facilitating this concentration of water rights and resources. This system often excluded people of color by law—specifically Native Americans, Black Americans, Asian Americans and Mexican Americans—who were denied access to land and, by extension, water.

As miners used water to blast mountainsides to mine for gold, they also silted up rivers, reducing the amount and quantity of water available for healthy rivers and ecosystems ([NOAA storymap](https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=ceebefd9685143daa5bf30d5a7e0c7fa)). This dynamic points to a broader taking and use of water without consideration for other people, fish, and other species. Water is life, but many people and species were excluded from the water they needed to thrive. These inequities have compounded over time, creating a foundation of water inequality that still defines California’s water landscape today.

## 2.3 20th century infrastructure entrenches inequities

The development of water infrastructure throughout the 20th century, particularly projects like the Central Valley Project (1930-1940) and the California State Water Project (1950s-1960s), further entrenched water inequities. These conveyance systems increased the reliability of water deliveries for those with water rights by diverting water from Northern California to Southern California and centralizing distribution. By doing so, they also entrenched the inequities in water access experienced by those who did not own land and water rights, who are disproportionately marginalized groups due to the laws mentioned above, while large-scale farming and areas experiencing urban growth benefitted ([Water Education](https://www.watereducation.org/aquapedia/central-valley-project)).For example, the Central Valley Project primarily benefited a small number of large landowners, leaving the communities of color that worked the land without access to the infrastructure needed for water distribution ([Eissinger, 2017](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3sd8t54n)). This concentration of power perpetuated the legacy of racialized exclusion that began in the 19th century, and communities of color often found themselves at the mercy of water policies that ignored their needs in favor of larger agribusinesses and urban interests. The California Department of Water Resources ([2022](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/About/Files/DWR-REAP-06142022-FINAL_ay11.pdf)) and the State Water Resources Control Board ([2021](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)) both acknowledge their active role in creating inequities in access to economic gains, affordable, clean water and other resources associated with water, particularly on the basis of race and ethnicity.

Infrastructure projects that moved and stored huge volumes of water north to south also disrupted the natural streamflow patterns and ecosystems upon which Indigenous and local communities relied. With over 41% of California’s native fish species now threatened or extinct, the ecological costs of these infrastructure projects have been severe ([Western Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPCH9khV8DI)). Sources of traditional healthy food like smelt, salmon, freshwater mussels, and freshwater plants are now less accessible ([SWB, 2021](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)). The question of equity in these water systems, therefore, is not just one of human access, but also about restoring Indigenous ways of life, ecosystem health, and other community subsistence and cultural resources.

## 2.4 Climate change is likely to exacerbate structural inequities

Climate change intensifies existing inequities in California’s historical water management systems. For example, sea-level rise and land subsidence threaten the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the critical water conduit for the state, jeopardizing the water supply for millions of Californians and farms ([Hanak and Gartrell](https://www.ppic.org/publication/the-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta/)). In addition, low-income and rural communities often rely on groundwater for drinking water, yet climate change is depleting aquifers and worsening water quality (cite?).

Those who have historically been excluded from policy and decision making often face negative mental and physical health impacts ([CA Water Plan, 2023](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/California-Water-Plan/Docs/Update2023/Final/California-Water-Plan-Update-2023.pdf)). These harms, when paired with less access to power or resources, make certain communities disproportionately vulnerable to climate change’s impact on water ([CA Water Plan, 2023](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/California-Water-Plan/Docs/Update2023/Final/California-Water-Plan-Update-2023.pdf)). Meanwhile, communities with the most political and financial capital—often those who have long held senior water rights—will have more resources to adapt ([Fencl, 2019](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2309839048?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses)). This means that wealthier, historically favored groups will be better positioned to weather challenges like water scarcity and flooding, while low-income and marginalized communities will likely face the brunt of the consequences due to past harms and a lack of climate-resilient infrastructure. The complexity and uncertainty of climate change contributes to these differences in ability to adapt as well. Senior water rights holders, more often have resources (legal, financial, data, etc.) to secure water during droughts and shortages, while low-income communities face rising costs for water ([Rachunok and Fletcher, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-022-00009-w)). At the same time, less favored groups face compounding risk because they are more likely to depend on substandard water infrastructure, and due to historical land and water dispossession, are more likely excluded formally or informally from governance decisions (cite Kristin’s SGMA paper?).

In these ways, climate change is likely to deepen the divide between those with power and those without. Therefore, achieving equitable outcomes is not a static, one-time effort. These efforts must be dynamic and responsive to ongoing, and locally-specific climatic challenges.

## 2.5 What’s happening today?

The legacy of these historical and structural inequities continues to affect water access at the household level today. For example, the State Water Board ([2021](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)) states that race is the strongest predictor of water and sanitation access. In addition, water debt and shutoffs disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color. A recent analysis showed that one in eight Californians carries water debt, and these rates are even higher among communities of color ([Botts](https://thecounter.org/water-debt-california-households-face-water-shutoffs-pandemic/), [State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/documents/ddwem/covid_financial_survey_board_ppt_20210119.pdf)). This financial burden creates a feedback loop that reinforces water access disparities, as families with debt may face shut offs or struggle to pay for increasingly expensive water service.

Additionally, renters, particularly in low-income communities, are at the mercy of landlords, who may neglect necessary infrastructure repairs. In communities where homeownership is unattainable, renters face the added challenge of water access vulnerability ([Cardoso, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032206)). For many, access to reliable water infrastructure remains a luxury, one shaped by socioeconomic status and the lasting effects of past inequities.

The State of California has recognized these water inequities and has taken steps toward a more equitable water future. The Human Right to Water, codified in California in 2012, reflects one attempt to address inequities in water access. The law seeks to ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable water, but more enforcement and funding are needed to achieve the law’s aspirations ([California Water Boards](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/)). One example of this funding is the Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER) Fund, which has provided $831 million for drinking water projects in disadvantaged communities ([2024 California Drinking Water Needs Assessment](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/needs/2024/2024-needs-assessment.pdf)). These funds aim to improve water infrastructure and provide technical assistance to small systems serving disadvantaged populations. California also began to legally protect Tribal Beneficial Uses of water for cultural and spiritual uses (e.g. navigation, ceremonies, fishing, and other activities) in 2017. Furthermore, In 2021, the State Water Board passed a resolution condemning racial injustice in 2021 ([SWB, 2021](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)), and the Department of Water Resources (DWR) developed a Racial Equity Action Plan in 2022 ([DWR, 2022](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021-0050.pdf)). Specifically, the Racial Equity Plan includes strategies to make DWR’s workforce more reflective of the state, improve community engagement with communities impacted by structural racism, and embed racial equity into projects and programs. Finally, California’s water plan update ([2023](https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/California-Water-Plan/Docs/Update2023/Final/California-Water-Plan-Update-2023.pdf)) lists these efforts and many others to advance water equity (in the form of legislation, state policies, funding assistance, technical assistance, and agency coordination, education and training). The water plan update also identifies efforts by local governments and utilities, plus additional forward looking actions the state can take, to advance water equity.

In addition to challenges with drinking water, California’s fish populations and ecosystems are experiencing significant harms due to past policies, built infrastructure, and water diversions. Eight percent of fish habitat, and 95 percent of salmonid spawning habitat has been blocked by dams ([NOAA storymap](https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=ceebefd9685143daa5bf30d5a7e0c7fa)). Recently, decades of organizing by Tribes led to the removal of the Klamath River dams, opening up 400 miles of salmon habitat ([Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-largest-dam-removal-project-in-us-history-begins-final-stretch-welcoming-salmon-home-180983621/)). California also implemented minimum flow requirements for streams, which provide benefits for maintaining life, but do not address the role of streamflow in supporting longer term ecosystem health in the form of habitat formation and maintenance ([Petts, 1996](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1646%28199607%2912:4/5%3C353::AID-RRR425%3E3.0.CO;2-6); [Yarnell, 2015](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/65/10/963/245807)). Increasingly, researchers and state and local water regulators are turning to “functional flow” regimes ([CA Water Blog](https://californiawaterblog.com/2025/02/23/functional-flows-are-good-for-californias-native-fishes/), [Trinity River Restoration Plan](https://www.trrp.net/restoration/flows/current/)) which attempt to reflect natural patterns of flow variability to facilitate important ecological functions ([Yarnell, 2015](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/65/10/963/245807)). Research shows that these flow regimes benefit native fish species while suppressing non-native species ([Baruch et al., 2024](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.3013)). To date, only a few streams and rivers in California are working toward a functional flows regime, but this approach could be expanded to more rivers.

The compounding nature of structural inequities, paired with a changing physical world (e.g. due to climate change), means that the specific equity challenges, and solutions needed to address them, will keep changing. Achieving equity is not a one-time effort, but an ongoing one. In addition, no single action will address structural inequity in California’s water allocation. However, many steps, taken together, can have a more meaningful positive impact. The COEQWAL project cannot address structural equity by itself. However, the project aims to provide more equitable access to data that can be used for advocacy and decision-making, and in doing so, be one of many efforts that contributes to reducing structural inequities.

## 2.6 Looking ahead & COEQWAL’s Role

The COEQWAL project was funded due to a recognition of complex interactions between water, climate change, ecosystems, and people with different interests and access to power. In the past and even today, groups with access to more financial, legal, and governance resources have used those resources to shape water decision making in ways that benefit them. One critical component of this is access to resources to model different water management regimes – including being able to run models at all, choosing what to model, and finally in interpreting and presenting modeling results. COEQWAL aims to model a broader set of water futures, working with historically underserved communities to model futures of interest to them. By making the project’s data available, COEQWAL aims to address one barrier (access to modeling and data) to overcoming structural inequities. While we recognize COEQWAL cannot address all structural equity challenges, we hope that this project contributes to that longer-term efforts in a meaningful and specific way so that in the future, water serves all Californians equitably, fairly, and sustainably.

How COEQWAL will empower Californians to influence water management decisions?** By building tools with diverse California communities, we amplify underrepresented voices, learn from each other, and build relationships. By opening access to the same water planning tools used by policymakers, people are empowered to explore more equitable water allocation possibilities. Through its co-development of data, tools and knowledge with diverse partners, COEQWAL opens opportunities for innovations in equity to emerge. (Source: COEQWAL Project Fact Sheet)

## 2.7 Summary

California’s water system has deep historical roots in inequity, including the displacement of Indigenous communities, reduction of water that support healthy ecosystems, and the concentration of water rights and infrastructure among wealthy, powerful groups. As discussed above, climate change often exacerbates these inequities. Addressing these disparities requires comprehensive, dynamic, and ever-adapting reforms that integrate equitable practices in water management, ensure accessibility for all communities, and restore ecosystems vital for long-term sustainability. COEQWAL aims to provide historically excluded communities with access to tools and data to help with decision making about how to achieve those objectives, and what tradeoffs, if any, would need to be considered when making those decisions. For example, our drinking water use case is working to understand how much water municipal systems will need to maintain healthy communities, while our salmon use case does the same for winter-run chinook salmon.

| Topic                      | Key Points                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Historical Context**     | California's water system has been shaped by power dynamics and policies that concentrate control, leading to inequities in access. This legacy is deeply embedded in water rights, infrastructure, institutions, and the distribution of power. |
| **19th Century Water Rights** | Indigenous communities practiced sustainable water management. However, settler colonialism and policies like the 1850 "Act for the Government and Protection of Indians" led to Indigenous displacement and exclusion from water rights. |
|                            | During the Gold Rush, water became a commodity, and the state’s appropriative water rights system prioritized settlers and large landowners, sidelining Indigenous and marginalized communities.         |
| **20th Century Infrastructure** | Large infrastructure projects like the Central Valley Project and California State Water Project benefited large agribusinesses and urban centers, while leaving marginalized groups, particularly communities of color, with limited access to water. |
|                            | These projects also disrupted natural ecosystems, leading to environmental degradation, including the extinction of native fish species.                                                              |
| **Climate Change Impact**  | Climate change exacerbates existing water inequalities as rising sea levels, droughts, and water supply issues threaten water supplies. Wealthier groups, with senior water rights, can better manage water shortages during climate events, while low-income communities face rising costs and shortages. |
|                            | Climate change further stresses native species and ecosystems, which often rely on advocacy for their water needs to be met.                                                                         |
| **Current Challenges**     | Californians of color are more likely to struggle to pay their water bills, poor infrastructure, and vulnerability to water shut offs.                                                                 |
|                            | The Human Right to Water (HR2W) law in California aims to ensure access to safe and affordable water but lacks strong enforcement mechanisms.                                                           |
|                            | Tribal ways of life and fish populations have been threatened or upended by water management that harms ecosystems.                                                                                    |
| **Efforts to Address Inequities** | State laws, funding, and policy documents recognize and are attempting to address inequities in drinking water access, but more needs to be done to achieve true water equity.                 |
|                            | Removal of some dams and the adoption of functional flow regimes on a few water bodies are supporting native species and ecosystems in meaningful, but small geographic regions. More effort is needed to restore native habitat and species in a changing climate. |
| **Equity Framework**       | The COEQWAL equity framework recognizes structural inequities in our water system, highlighting the motivation for the project, and considers how actions to address recognitional, procedural, and distributional equity can ultimately lead to transformational equity and enhanced structural equity. |

# 3 Recognitional Equity: Respect for Diverse Water Needs and Cultural Practices

---

## 3.1 Recognitional Equity Dimensions

| Recognitional Equity: Project Objective: | Recognitional equity involves acknowledging and respecting diverse water values and uses, particularly those tied to historical, cultural, and ecological relationships with water. It also involves fair and inclusive representation, recognition, and respect for diverse cultural identities, traditions, and practices in water governance and specifically ensures that historically marginalized communities have equitable access to resources, opportunities, and decision-making power. COEQWAL recognizes that communities value and use water in different ways, including cultural, spiritual, and ecological traditions that are central to Indigenous and disenfranchised groups. The project enhances recognitional equity by (i) ensuring diverse voices are included in engagement activities; (ii) elevating marginalized perspectives in project decisions; (iii) integrating traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and Indigenous water stewardship practices into water planning; and (iv) aligning water governance with cultural and ecological priorities, particularly in the four COEQWAL use cases. |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Recognitional equity in water allocation ensures the fair acknowledgment, respect, and inclusion of diverse cultural identities, practices, and historical relationships with water resources. In California—where water governance intersects with Indigenous rights, racial and socioeconomic disparities, and diverse ecological values—ensuring cultural perspectives are recognized and represented is essential for achieving just and equitable water management. The COEQWAL project integrates recognitional and cultural equity by incorporating community knowledge, traditions, and environmental values into water governance, ensuring that marginalized communities have a voice in decision-making. The project also directly addresses four critical use cases that exemplify the intersection of equity, sustainability, and water resource management:

1.  **Reliable Drinking Water –** Ensuring that low-income communities and rural areas have access to safe, clean, and affordable drinking water.
2.  **Salmon Recovery –** Supporting Tribal and community-led efforts to restore salmon populations, which are both ecologically and culturally significant.
3.  **Environmental Flows –** Preserving rivers, wetlands, and aquatic ecosystems to support biodiversity and ecological health.
4.  **Just Transitions & Salinity –** Addressing the long-term impacts of water salinity on agricultural and drinking water systems while ensuring an equitable transition for affected communities.

Each of these use cases highlights a different but interconnected dimension of recognitional and cultural equity, emphasizing that water management must account for both human and ecological needs while addressing historical and systemic disparities.

## 3.2 Aspects of Recognitional Equity

COEQWAL operationalizes recognitional and cultural equity by structuring its processes around key aspects that ensure the representation of diverse water needs, values, and cultural perspectives (see Figure 5).

**Figure 5.** Aspects of Recognitional Equity in California’s water management center on inclusion to address under-representation and bias in terms of language, class, race and ethnicity, geography, and gender.

The following Table summarizes key elements of recognitional equity in the COEQWAL project:

| Language         | Ensure accessibility for non-English speakers through multilingual materials, culturally relevant workshops, and translated resources. Respect linguistic diversity by consulting culturally relevant expressions and terminologies. |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gender**       | Promote inclusive representation of women, non-binary, and other gender identities in water policy discussions.                                                                                                                     |
| **Geography**    | Recognize unique water challenges faced by urban, rural, and Tribal areas, particularly where environmental changes impact water quality and availability.                                                                         |
| **Race/Ethnicity** | Address racial disparities in water access and infrastructure quality, ensuring that historically excluded groups have a seat at the table. Elevate perspectives to ethnically and racially diverse groups in project design and implementation |
| **Class**        | Acknowledge economic disparities that affect access to affordable water, agricultural sustainability, and environmental conservation.                                                                                              |

Considering these differences ensures that COEQWAL addresses systemic inequities while respecting and uplifting the cultural significance of water across diverse communities. Each of these aspects is deeply connected to COEQWAL’s four use cases, ensuring that recognitional equity directly influences practical outcomes.

## 3.3 Representation Goals

A key strategy in COEQWAL’s approach is the intentional establishment of diverse representation goals, ensuring that community partners reflect organizational, demographic, and geographic diversity. We aim to include organizations that represent rural farmers, Tribal Nations, low-income urban communities, and immigrant populations, as well as those more commonly represented in water decision-making, such as state and federal agencies, water districts, and environmental NGOs. COEQWAL prioritizes the inclusion of Tribal representatives and Indigenous water stewards in project planning and decision-making:

*   **Demographic Goals –**
    *   Ensure broad representation across different ages, races, ethnicities, income levels, and gender identities in water governance.
*   **Geographic Goals –**
    *   Engage community groups from key regions—including the Central Valley and Delta, Trinity River Basin, and Southern California municipal water supply area—to reflect the state’s diverse water challenges.

These goals help bridge gaps in participation and knowledge-sharing, ensuring that the COEQWAL project reflects the priorities of affected communities rather than just powerful water-rights holders.

## 3.4 Recognitional Equity in COEQWAL Use Cases

COEQWAL’s approach to recognitional equity is reflected in our four priority use cases, each of which focuses on a key challenge in California’s water system:

1.  **Reliable Drinking Water**
    *   Incorporates supply reliability metrics into CalSim outputs, ensuring that water allocation scenarios reflect the community drinking water implications.
    *   Uses model outputs to highlight disparities in water accessibility \[and affordability?\], informing decision-making on policies that prioritize human right-to-water needs.
2.  **Salmon Recovery**
    *   Adjusts flow scenarios to include adequate water for fish passage and habitat restoration, ensuring that Tribal and ecological water needs are reflected in CalSim simulations.
    *   Evaluates the impact of altered flow regimes on salmon populations, allowing participants to assess trade-offs between environmental protections and water diversions.
    *   Outputs from these models help visualize where and how water allocation decisions affect Indigenous fishing rights, ecological health, and river system resilience.
3.  **Environmental Flows**
    *   Integrates environmental flow requirements directly into the model constraints, ensuring that river health and ecosystem balance are considered alongside human water demands.
    *   Uses CalSim outputs to identify disparities in flow allocations that could negatively impact culturally significant water bodies, allowing for real-time scenario adjustments.
    *   Helps visualize how different water management strategies affect river and wetland preservation, aquifer recharge, and ecosystem stability in various geographic contexts.
4.  **Just Transitions & Salinity**
    *   Incorporates salinity dynamics into CalSim, allowing stakeholders to evaluate how salinity buildup affects agricultural land, groundwater supplies, and rural drinking water access.
    *   Uses model outputs to assess long-term risks to disadvantaged communities dependent on already stressed water systems, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley and Delta regions.
    *   Helps inform equitable adaptation strategies by modeling alternative water allocations that reduce salinity impacts while balancing agricultural and municipal water demands.

These use cases highlight COEQWAL’s commitment to ensuring that water governance is not only technically effective but also socially and culturally just.

This table outlines the recognitional and cultural equity metrics for COEQWAL, ensuring diverse cultural perspectives, needs, and values are recognized and integrated into the water allocation process in California. The metrics are aligned with organizational, demographic, and geographic strategies to promote fair and inclusive water governance across communities.

# 4 Procedural Equity: Inclusive, Transparent, and Participatory Decision-Making

---

## 4.1 Procedural Equity Dimension

| Procedural Equity:   | Procedural equity in COEQWAL ensures that research, planning, and decision-making processes are inclusive, transparent, and fair, with an emphasis on meaningful participation from vulnerable communities. It establishes clear and open pathways for engagement, ensuring that historically underrepresented voices have a role in shaping water management discussions. |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Objective:** | COEQWAL is designed to integrate scientific models, data, and participatory decision-making tools into a collaborative framework. By combining technical and social factors, the project seeks to make water-related data and decision-making processes accessible, transparent, and meaningful for all participants.                                                          |

Procedural equity in water governance ensures that decision-making processes are fair, inclusive, and accessible to all stakeholders, particularly historically marginalized communities. In California, where water management decisions are often complex and heavily influenced by regulatory structures, ensuring procedural transparency and inclusivity is critical to building trust, fostering collaboration, and advancing equitable water outcomes. The COEQWAL project integrates procedural equity by establishing accessible, participatory, and transparent processes that allow all communities to engage meaningfully in discussions about water allocation. This approach ensures that those most affected by water policies are involved in shaping them, rather than being left out of critical conversations. COEQWAL also emphasizes open communication, trust-building, and shared learning as essential components of procedural fairness.

## 4.2 Aspects of Procedural Equity

The project directly addresses procedural equity through four core dimensions that shape equitable participation as well as project implementation and outputs:

1.  **Accessibility –** Ensuring all participants can engage regardless of background, technical expertise, or resources.
2.  **Open Communication –** Creating continuous, clear, and inclusive information exchange with participants.
3.  **Transparency –** Making decision-making, modeling assumptions, and project outcomes visible and understandable to all participants.
4.  **Social Learning –** Facilitating collective learning and knowledge-sharing among participants through webinars, workshops, break-out sessions, etc.
5.  **Trust –** Establishing confidence, reliability, and credibility between participants and the project team.

By embedding these principles into COEQWAL’s framework, the project not only improves participation in project planning but also ensures that the decision-making processes and project output are just, inclusive, and representative of the communities it serves (see Figure 6).

[Image: Figure 6. COEQWAL’s goal of promoting equitable water allocation is served through attention to how the project is executed: its process and procedures. To this end, the project envisions and measures procedural equity through the lenses of accessibility, open communication, transparency, social learning and trust. Each of these perspectives has its own set of key indicators (outlined in blue text).]

## 4.3 Accessibility

COEQWAL’s goal for accessibility is to ensure that all participants, regardless of their background, resources, or technical expertise, can engage with the collaborative process and have meaningful participation in the project. The ways in which we assess accessibility include:

*   **Physical Accessibility** involves holding community meetings or workshops in accessible locations that can easily be reached by participants. In COEQWAL, most of our project meetings are held in the Sacramento/Davis area, where a disproportionate number of our community partners live. The location is also close to a regional airport and is accessible by major highways. COEQWAL also compensates participants for any travel expenses associated with participation in project-related meetings. When possible and feasible, project meetings and workshops offer remote participation options to ensure that members who are unable to travel in-person can still attend.
*   **Knowledge Accessibility** involves the development of communication strategies and products that help diverse participants, including those without technical expertise, to understand and meaningfully engage with complex topics such as water allocation modeling and climate change. It also involves providing information in multiple formats (visual aids, plain language summaries, audio, etc.) to accommodate various learning styles, literacy levels, and access to technology.
*   **Language and Cultural Accessibility** involves ensuring that information, tools, and discussions are available in the languages spoken by the participants involved in the process. This is particularly important in a linguistically diverse state like California, where many communities speak languages other than English. For COEQWAL, we will provide a Spanish translation of project informational materials and website content. This will be expanded into other languages beyond these 2-years.
*   **Digital Accessibility** involves the development of strategies and products to make technical information and tools user-friendly and accessible to individuals with different levels of experience with data. This includes ensuring access to our scenario and data results through an interactive web platform that supports varying levels of understanding and data literacy.

## 4.4 Open Communication

The goal of open communication throughout the project is to foster continuous, clear, and inclusive information exchange with participants to ensure mutual understanding and that all participants, regardless of their background, resources, or technical expertise, can engage with the collaborative process and have meaningful participation in the project. Ways in which open communication is supported are listed below:

*   **Frequency of Communication** refers to how often communication takes place between the project team and participants. Frequent communication ensures that participants are consistently informed and engaged, reducing uncertainty and promoting sustained engagement.The COEQWAL leadership communicates with the research team and community partners through monthly newsletters, webinars in response to community interests and/or project needs, and in-person community meetings and workshops that occur on approximately quarterly basis.
*   **Quality of Member Participation considers** the level of involvement and engagement of participants, such as providing feedback, sharing ideas, or asking questions. Active participation ensures that participants are not just receiving information, but also contributing to the dialogue, which helps shape decision-making and makes the process more inclusive. The COEQWAL team evaluates the quality of participation through surveys prior to and following meetings and other project events.
*   **Representation in Participation** refers to how well the interests, concerns, and perspectives of diverse participant groups are reflected in communications. Ensuring all relevant participants are represented in communications means that no group is left out, and their unique needs and perspectives are considered. COEQWAL evaluates the representation of participation through surveys prior to and following meetings and other project events.

## 4.5 Transparency

The goal of transparency is to make decision-making, assumptions, and project outcomes visible and understandable to all participants (i.e. project team, steering committee, advisory cohort). The ways in which we assess transparency in COEQWAL include clarity of project, model transparency, participant involvement in scenario development and interpretation, as described below.

*   **Clarity of Process** refers to how clearly the goals, limitations, steps, and decision-making procedures of the project are communicated to participants. Clear communication of how the project is organized and run helps participants understand the process, reducing confusion and fostering trust. It ensures that all groups know how their input is being used and what to expect at each stage. To enhance clarity of process, COEQWAL has developed a project brief, provides regular updates on project progress, and evaluates the extent to which participants understand the goals and processes guiding the project through surveys.
*   **Model Transparency** considers the clarity and openness of the underlying assumptions, inputs, outputs, and methodologies used in the modeling process. Transparent models allow participants to understand how data and assumptions influence the outcomes, making it easier to interpret and trust the results. It’s essential for ensuring that models are not "black boxes" but rather understandable, interpretable tools that participants can engage with. In COEQWAL, we have conducted a study to understand the assumptions embedded in the CalSim3 model and are focusing on providing clear, accessible descriptions of model assumptions, data inputs and outputs, and limitations on the project’s knowledge platform.
*   **Participant Involvement in Data Interpretation** refers to the degree to which participants are involved in interpreting data and understanding the implications of the model results. Actively involving participants in the interpretation process helps ensure that diverse perspectives are considered and that the conclusions drawn from the data reflect the needs and realities of the affected communities. It also empowers participants to challenge or refine interpretations based on their own knowledge and experiences. COEQWAL involves regularly organizing workshops and webinars in which participants engage in interpreting model results. Feedback is documented and post-event reports provide a summary of how participant comments and questions were considered and integrated in the project.

## 4.6 Social Learning

The goal of social learning throughout project implementation and co-design is to facilitate collective learning among participants through shared knowledge, experiences, and perspectives.

*   **Frequency and Diversity of Collaborative Learning Opportunities:** This refers to how often and in what variety of formats participants are provided opportunities to collaborate, share knowledge, and learn together. Frequent and diverse learning opportunities encourage active engagement, foster knowledge exchange, and ensure that participants from various backgrounds and perspectives can contribute. Diversity in learning opportunities (workshops, meetings, webinars, etc.) helps reach different groups with varying learning preferences.
*   **Knowledge Sharing Rate:** The rate at which participants share their knowledge, insights, and experiences with one another during collaborative learning sessions. A higher knowledge sharing rate indicates that participants are actively contributing to the learning process, enriching the collective understanding of water allocation and management. It also signals a culture of openness and trust.
*   **Adaptation of Models Based on participant Input:** The degree to which participant input is integrated into the decision-making process, particularly in updating or refining models and scenarios used for water allocation. Effective social learning involves continuous adaptation of models or strategies based on the knowledge and feedback gathered from participants. This ensures that models and other project output are not only scientifically rigorous but also reflective of real-world insights and local knowledge.

## 4.7 Trust

The goal of building trust between participants and the project team throughout project implementation and co-design is to build and maintain mutual respect, reliability, and confidence among participants.

*   **Participant Satisfaction:** This refers to how satisfied participants are with their overall experience and involvement in the process. High participant satisfaction indicates that participants feel their concerns are being heard, their needs are being addressed, and they are valued in the decision-making process. Satisfaction is a key indicator of trust in the process and the groups involved. COEQWAL evaluates participant satisfaction through surveys following meetings and other project events.
*   **Consistency and Reliability:** This refers to how consistently the processes, actions, and communication are carried out, and how reliable the project outcomes are over time. Trust is built when participants experience that processes are predictable, dependable, and do not change unexpectedly. Consistent and reliable actions demonstrate integrity, fostering long-term trust between participants and the project team.

# 5 Distributional Equity: Fair and Adequate Allocation of Water Resources

---

## 5.1 Distributional Equity Dimension

| Distributional Equity: | Prioritize equitable distribution of water resources                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Objective:** | Model a broader range of water distribution scenarios, and for each, provide multiple assessments of distributional equity based on different justice principles. |

Distributional equity describes the equitable allocation of resources. The extent to which water is equitably distributed among users is ultimately determined by water agencies and political leaders. However, in the context of COEQWAL, we are considering two elements of distributional equity. First, the project aims to deliver equitable benefits to the public. This means that the tools, information, and resources developed by the project can be accessed and used by diverse organizations and groups with differing levels of knowledge, technical expertise, and interests. We are particularly focused on ensuring that our products are accessible and relevant to communities that have been historically marginalized from decision making. The second element of distributional equity addressed in COEQWAL is the nature of the scenarios we develop and the manner in which water allocation scenario outcomes are evaluated. COEQWAL is developing a wide range of scenarios that are intended to illuminate strategies for more equitable water management. The project is also developing a series of metrics, informed by justice principles, that provide insights into the distributional equity of water allocations among the scenarios.

## 5.2 Equitable Distribution of Project Benefits

In addition to ensuring equitable water allocation at a broader scale, COEQWAL is committed to equitable distribution of project benefits. This means ensuring that the tools, information, and resources developed by the project are accessible and useful to all stakeholders, particularly those historically excluded from decision-making processes. COEQWAL addresses this goal by integrating recognitional/cultural and procedural equity into its approach. Recognitional/cultural equity ensures that diverse cultural, historical, and community perspectives are valued and included in project design. Procedural equity guarantees that decision-making processes are inclusive, transparent, and accessible to all communities. By embedding these equity dimensions into COEQWAL, we strive to:

*   **Enhance Accessibility –** Develop multilingual, culturally relevant, and community-focused resources that help historically marginalized communities access and utilize COEQWAL’s water modeling tools.
*   **Foster Representation –** Ensure that community organizations, Indigenous groups, and underrepresented voices play a key role in shaping water allocation scenarios.
*   **Facilitate Transparent Decision-Making –** Implement open forums, workshops, and interactive decision-making processes where communities can engage directly with policymakers and scientists.
*   **Support Data Empowerment –** Provide access to datasets and decision-support tools in ways that allow community advocates to meaningfully interpret and use them for local water planning and advocacy.

By prioritizing these strategies, COEQWAL ensures that its project outputs benefit communities equitably and that historically marginalized groups are not only included but actively shape the project’s direction.

## 5.3 Justice Principles in Distributional Equity

When evaluating perceptions of water equity, justice principles provide useful frameworks to guide how resources—specifically water—should be allocated across different communities, groups, and ecosystems. These principles reflect both ethical and practical considerations and values, ensuring that water distribution accounts for human needs, environmental health, and fairness. COEQWAL will apply multiple justice frameworks to assess distributional equity in water allocation. These principles provide structured ways to measure equity across different communities and uses:

*   **Proportional Equity –** Allocates water based on historical contributions, investments, or entitlements. While it recognizes prior commitments, it risks reinforcing past inequities that favored wealthier or more politically powerful groups, more or less representing the status quo (Rawls, 1971; Boelens, 2015).
*   **Equality –** Ensures every entity receives the same share of water, regardless of need, history, or geography. Though simple and transparent, this approach does not account for varying water needs or disparities in existing access (Sen, 1992; Young, 1990).
*   **Needs-Based Equity –** Prioritizes essential water uses such as drinking water, sanitation, and subsistence agriculture before commercial or industrial needs. This principle emphasizes the needs of vulnerable communities, including Indigenous groups and low-income rural populations (Fraser, 2009; Raworth, 2017).
*   **Burden-Sharing Equity –** Ensures that water conservation measures, costs, and restrictions are fairly distributed. This prevents marginalized communities from bearing a disproportionate share of water scarcity hardships while wealthier groups continue high consumption (Ostrom, 1990; Mehta, 2005).
*   **Spatial Equity –** Recognizes regional differences in water availability and access, ensuring fair distribution across urban, rural, and tribal areas. It addresses infrastructure gaps and local needs, such as irrigation in agricultural zones or clean drinking water in under-resourced regions (Harvey & Reed, 2006; Gober, 2018).
*   **Multi-Benefit Equity –** Balances human, environmental, and economic needs in water distribution. For instance, prioritizing wetland restoration can enhance biodiversity, improve water quality, and sustain Indigenous cultural practices (Pahl-Wostl, 2015; Berkes, 2008).
*   **Reparational Equity –** Seeks to correct historical injustices by restoring water rights to Indigenous and historically excluded communities. This principle requires policy shifts, infrastructure investment, and legal recognition of past harm (Whyte, 2018; Pulido, 2016).
*   **Intergenerational Equity –** Ensures that water management decisions today do not compromise the needs of future generations. Sustainable practices such as groundwater recharge and ecosystem restoration are essential to maintaining long-term water security (Brown Weiss, 1989; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2004).

Water equity is shaped by various justice principles (i.e. values), each offering different perspectives on how resources should be allocated. These principles often conflict, creating trade-offs between competing needs, interests, and ecological imperatives. By presenting the outcomes under different justice frameworks, COEQWAL aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of distributional equity in water management. Rather than assuming that balancing these approaches is the most equitable solution, COEQWAL focuses on providing transparent information about the implications of different allocation strategies. This allows communities, policymakers, and stakeholders to assess equity from multiple angles and determine what is perceived as just and fair within their specific contexts. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all communities—particularly those most vulnerable—have equitable access to water resources while sustaining both human and ecological needs for the long term.

## 5.4 Combining & Balancing Justice Principles

It is possible—and often necessary—to use a combination of justice principles to achieve a more comprehensive and equitable approach to water allocation. In reality, water management decisions rarely align perfectly with a single principle. Instead, a blended approach allows for more nuance and responsiveness to local contexts, balancing the trade-offs among different equity considerations.

[Image: Figure 8. Once developed, various equity frameworks can be combined to balance perspectives on water allocation approaches. In reality, water management decisions rarely align perfectly with a single framework. Using a mix allows for a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach that can better address the complexities of water equity. For example, in drought conditions, water may be distributed proportionally based on rights, but additional resources may be directed to groups with greater needs like urban populations in underserved areas without other sources of water.]

Below is a discussion of how combining these principles can provide more holistic solutions:

1.  **Combining Proportionality and Needs-Based Allocation** – Proportionality can be adjusted to account for needs-based distribution. For example, communities historically deprived of water access may receive a larger share of their water demand, even if they have made a smaller contribution to the overall water system. This ensures that those in greatest need (e.g., Indigenous communities or low-income areas) are prioritized while maintaining a sense of proportional fairness.
    *   *Example:* In drought conditions, water may be distributed mostly based on proportional rights, but additional resources may be directed to marginalized groups to ensure their needs are met, such as agricultural communities with limited irrigation access or urban populations in underserved areas.
2.  **Balancing Equality and Needs-Based Equity** – While equality ensures that every individual or community receives the same share of water, needs-based equity recognizes that some groups require additional resources due to socio-economic disparities, environmental challenges, or historical marginalization. Combining these principles ensures that while baseline allocations are equal, adjustments are made for those with the greatest needs.
    *   *Example:* Equal water allocation might be applied broadly, but marginalized or low-income groups may receive additional financial support (e.g., subsidies or funding for infrastructure) to ensure they do not bear disproportionate costs.
3.  **Integrating Burden-Sharing and Proportionality** – While proportional equity acknowledges historical investments in water systems, burden-sharing ensures that those benefiting most from water access also contribute to the costs of conservation, infrastructure, and sustainability. This approach prevents wealthier or high-use groups from monopolizing resources while ensuring marginalized communities do not bear an unfair burden.
    *   *Example:* Large agribusinesses or urban centers could contribute more to infrastructure improvements or conservation programs, while lower-income communities receive assistance to ensure fair access to water resources.
4.  **Aligning Spatial Equity with Multi-Benefit Equity** – Spatial equity ensures that water is allocated fairly across regions, accounting for unique geographic needs. When combined with multi-benefit equity, water management strategies prioritize solutions that simultaneously improve environmental sustainability, economic opportunities, and human well-being.
    *   *Example:* In a region with both urban and agricultural demands, water allocation may be designed to not only provide drinking water and irrigation but also to support wetland restoration projects that benefit biodiversity and local economies.
5.  **Combining Reparational and Needs-Based Equity** – Water allocation decisions should account for past injustices while also addressing current disparities in access. Reparational equity ensures that historically excluded communities receive their fair share of resources, while needs-based equity ensures that these communities have the water necessary for essential uses.
    *   *Example:* A water rights reallocation program could prioritize Indigenous communities that have historically been denied access to water, while also ensuring that disadvantaged rural areas receive infrastructure investments to improve water security.
6.  **Integrating Intergenerational and Burden-Sharing Equity** – Intergenerational equity ensures that water management decisions protect future water availability, while burden-sharing ensures that current users contribute fairly to these long-term sustainability efforts. This combination helps balance the immediate needs of water users with the responsibility of ensuring future generations have adequate resources.
    *   *Example:* Groundwater extraction limits could be placed on industries and large-scale agriculture to ensure aquifer sustainability, while revenue from higher extraction fees is reinvested in conservation and replenishment projects.
7.  **Balancing Spatial Equity with Reparational Equity** – Many historically marginalized communities also face geographic challenges in accessing clean and reliable water. By combining these principles, water policies can ensure that allocation considers both historical injustices and contemporary regional disparities.
    *   *Example:* A policy initiative could prioritize infrastructure investment in both historically underserved communities and remote rural regions that lack modern water systems.
8.  **A Holistic Approach: Integrating Multiple Principles** – In many cases, achieving equitable water distribution requires the application of multiple principles simultaneously. A comprehensive approach ensures that proportionality, fairness, needs-based allocation, burden-sharing, spatial considerations, and long-term sustainability all factor into decision-making.
    *   *Example:* In a drought scenario, proportionality might guide initial allocations, but additional prioritization may be given to marginalized communities, ecosystems, and future water security. Water surpluses might be redirected from urban areas to rural and Indigenous communities while ensuring environmental needs are met.

Using a combination of justice principles allows for a more flexible, context-sensitive, and fair approach to water management. By integrating multiple perspectives, policymakers can ensure that water resources are not only distributed efficiently but also equitably across different communities and environmental systems. This approach fosters legitimacy, sustainability, and resilience in water decision-making processes.

## 5.5 Integrated Justice Principles for COEQWAL Use Cases

The principles of equity and justice can be applied to COEQWAL’s use cases, including salmon protection, environmental flow (eflow) allocation, just transitions in salinity management, and drinking water distribution. By using metrics that align with these principles, we ensure fair, transparent, and context-sensitive water distribution, promoting both human and ecological well-being.

---

**1. Salmon Protection –** Salmon are crucial to ecosystems and hold significant cultural, ecological, and economic value. Protecting salmon populations requires equitable water management that supports their life cycles and habitats.

*   **Proportionality:** Water should be allocated to salmon in relation to their ecological and cultural importance, prioritizing times of migration or spawning.
*   **Needs:** Priority should be given to critical salmon habitats during times of scarcity, ensuring sufficient flow for spawning, migration, and ecosystem health.
*   **Inter-species Equity:** Water must be allocated to maintain salmon populations and broader biodiversity, ensuring other species dependent on aquatic ecosystems are considered.
*   **Burden:** The costs of protecting salmon (e.g., water restrictions) should be shared by all stakeholders based on their water usage and ability to adapt.

**Key Metrics for Salmon Protection**:

In the context of salmon protection, the goal is to ensure that water resources are allocated in a way that supports the needs of salmon populations, their habitats, and the environmental services that sustain them. The following table provides distributional equity metrics that measure how water resources are allocated and the extent to which salmon-related needs (e.g., water quantity and quality, temperature, spawner abundance, population productivity) are considered in the water management process:

| Metric                                           | Equity Principle                | Description/Formula                                                                                                                                                                                               | Data Sources                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Water Quantity Allocated for Salmon              | Needs, Proportionality          | **Water Quantity for Salmon:** Measure the total volume of water allocated to salmon habitats and spawning areas relative to total water resources. Higher allocation signifies greater attention to salmon needs.    | California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) US Geological Survey (USGS) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) |
| Water Quality (Salinity, Dissolved Oxygen, etc.) | Needs, Proportionality          | **Water Quality for Salmon:** Evaluate the level of water quality (salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH) in salmon habitats and spawning areas, ensuring they meet the needs of salmon populations.                  | California Water Quality Control Board NOAA Fisheries California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) |
| Water Temperature for Salmon Habitats            | Needs, Proportionality          | **Thermal Habitat Suitability:** Measure how water temperature in salmon habitats compares to optimal ranges for spawning, migration, and juvenile development.                                                  | California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) USGS NOAA Fisheries                                   |
| Spawner Abundance                                | Needs, Proportionality          | **Spawner Abundance:** Measure the number of adult salmon that return to spawn in rivers and streams, indicating the health of the population and the effectiveness of water allocation for salmon habitats.   | California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) NOAA Fisheries US Fish and Wildlife Service             |
| Population Productivity                          | Needs, Proportionality          | **Population Productivity:** Calculate the number of offspring per adult spawner, measuring the productivity of salmon populations in relation to water resources allocated to their habitats.               | California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) NOAA Fisheries USGS                                   |
| Freshwater Productivity (Primary Production)     | Needs, Inter-species Equity     | **Freshwater Productivity:** Measure the productivity of freshwater ecosystems, such as algae, aquatic plants, and invertebrates, which are critical food sources for salmon, ensuring ecosystem support.      | USGS NOAA Fisheries California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)                                   |
| Extinction Risk                                  | Needs, Proportionality          | **Extinction Risk for Salmon:** Evaluate the likelihood of salmon populations becoming endangered or extinct due to inadequate water quality, quantity, or temperature. This metric reflects the balance between water allocation for salmon and their survival. | California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) NOAA Fisheries International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) |
| Proportion of Water Allocation Prioritized for the Environment | Fairness, Proportionality | **Environmental Water Allocation:** Measure the proportion of total water allocated specifically for ecological purposes, including salmon protection, versus other water uses such as agriculture or urban needs. | California Department of Water Resources (DWR) California Water Boards NOAA Fisheries                    |

In order to implement distributional equity metrics for salmon protection, it’s essential to apply these measures in the context of decision-making processes that involve trade-offs between competing water uses (e.g., agricultural, urban, ecological). By calculating these metrics, water managers can gain a clearer picture of how salmon protection intersects with broader water resource allocation goals, and identify areas where adjustments may be needed to ensure that the needs of salmon populations are prioritized fairly.

---

**2. Environmental Flow (E-flows) Allocation –** E-flows refer to the water necessary to maintain healthy ecosystems, which often requires releasing specific amounts of water into rivers, wetlands, or groundwater to support biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem services.

*   **Proportionality:** Water for eflows should be allocated based on the **value** and **vulnerability** of ecosystems, ensuring that ecosystems critical for long-term sustainability get enough water, even if it means limiting other water uses.
*   **Needs:** Water must prioritize ecosystems with the **greatest need**, especially those at risk of collapse (e.g., during drought or low-flow conditions).
*   **Fairness:** Distribute water equitably across ecosystems, considering the **long-term impact** of water scarcity on both human and ecological communities.

**Key Metrics for Environmental Flows**:

In the context of Environmental Flows (Eflows), the goal is to ensure that water allocation prioritizes the needs of ecosystems, enhances ecological services, and respects Tribal beneficial uses while also promoting socioeconomic benefits and nature-based solutions. The following table outlines distributional equity metrics focused on water quality, quantity, and the broader ecosystem needs, such as Tribal uses, riparian floodplains, and ecological services:

| Metric                                               | Equity Principle                 | Description/Formula                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Data Sources                                                                                                                                   |

These distributional equity metrics provide an essential framework for ensuring that environmental flows not only meet the ecological needs of ecosystems but also benefit vulnerable communities and promote socio economic stability and long-term sustainability. The metrics are designed to balance ecological health (e.g., water quality, ecological services, and biodiversity) with the cultural and economic needs of Tribal communities and local economies. Key decision-makers—whether in water resource management, environmental policy, or community development—can use these metrics to prioritize water allocations that respect both environmental and social equity considerations. By integrating these metrics into modeling processes, stakeholders can evaluate trade-offs between water for ecosystems and water for human consumption, ensuring a fairer and more inclusive approach to managing limited water resources.

**3. Just Transitions in Salinity Management –** The concept of Just Transitions refers to ensuring that the shift toward more sustainable, equitable, and environmentally responsible practices is inclusive, fair, and addresses the needs of marginalized communities. In the context of salinity management, it is crucial to design and implement policies and practices that balance environmental sustainability, economic viability, and social equity. Just transitions aim to ensure that the costs and benefits of managing salinity do not disproportionately burden already vulnerable communities, but instead empower them through the process.

*   **Proportionality:** Allocate water to control salinity based on risk levels and the importance of affected communities (e.g., urban areas vs. rural communities).
*   **Self-interest:** Stakeholders in urban and agricultural sectors, who benefit from salinity control, should contribute more resources to mitigate salinity.
*   **Burden:** Distribute the financial and operational costs of managing salinity based on the ability to bear the burden, ensuring disadvantaged communities are not overburdened.

**Key Metrics for Just Transitions in Salinity Management**:

In the context of salinity management, applying just transition principles can be tracked using specific equity metrics that measure the distribution of costs and benefits across various groups, especially marginalized communities. Below are key metrics that integrate justice and equity principles into salinity management:

| Metric                                               | Equity Principle                             | Formula/Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Data Sources                                                                                                                                   |

**4. Drinking Water Allocation –** Access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, and the allocation of drinking water must prioritize vulnerable populations.

*   **Proportionality:** Water for drinking should be allocated **proportionate to need**, ensuring that vulnerable or marginalized communities receive priority access, especially in times of scarcity.
*   **Equality:** Ensure **equal access** to safe drinking water for all communities, regardless of socio-economic status, race, or geography.
*   **Burden:** The costs of infrastructure and water provision should be distributed equitably, with wealthier or more powerful communities contributing to funding solutions for under-served areas.

**Key Metrics for Drinking Water Allocation**:

In the drinking water allocation use case, the primary focus is ensuring that water resources are distributed in a way that meets human health and safety needs, promotes affordability, and mitigates the economic burden on vulnerable communities. The following table outlines distributional equity metrics to track and assess water allocation effectiveness, focusing on quantity, affordability, quality, and infrastructure investments for drinking water access:

| Economic Burden of Water Costs                                          | Burden, Fairness        | **Economic Burden:** Measure the proportion of household income spent on water services. Higher indices indicate that lower-income communities bear a disproportionate share of the costs. Measure the consumer welfare loss due to water shortages based on the demand unit level. Since different water communities/systems vary in population size, service areas, and income levels, the economic burden effects will differ among communities/systems. By comparing welfare losses across these communities, it reveals how the economic burden is distributed based on community characteristics. Specifically, are low-income and underserved areas unfairly impacted by experiencing greater welfare losses?

By utilizing these distributional equity metrics, stakeholders can assess the effectiveness of drinking water allocation strategies in meeting the needs of vulnerable populations. The Total System Deliveries Compared to Total Demand and Health and Safety Demand metrics ensure that the essential needs of all communities are prioritized, especially in regions where water resources are scarce. The Economic Burden and Affordability Index allows policymakers to measure and address the financial challenges faced by low-income households.

## 5.6 Conclusions

In conclusion, this chapter has highlighted the critical role of distributional equity in water allocation decision-making, particularly within the context of California's complex and contested water system. By embedding justice principles, the COEQWAL Equity Framework aims to address long-standing disparities in water access and environmental protection. This approach acknowledges that the impacts of water management decisions are not distributed equitably and that vulnerable communities, ecosystems, and Indigenous rights must be recognized to achieve just and sustainable outcomes.

The four use cases explored in this chapter—focused on salmon protection, environmental flow (eflow) management, a just transition for salinity management, and equitable drinking water distribution—demonstrate the diverse ways that equity principles can be operationalized in practice. Each case presents unique challenges and opportunities, but collectively, they emphasize the need for decision-making that is responsive to both human and ecological needs. The intersectionality of these issues requires a nuanced understanding of how different sectors and communities are impacted by water policies and interventions – the justice principles provide different/ plural entry points to explore this. Integrated modeling collaboratories, such as COEQWAL, offer a powerful tool for identifying and addressing inequities, enabling more informed, transparent, and inclusive water decision-making. By fostering collaboration among groups — from marginalized communities to policymakers — this approach helps balance competing demands on California’s water resources and promotes equitable, effective solutions. The modeling platform facilitates cross-sector dialogue, uncovering synergies, trade-offs, and opportunities to discover justice-oriented water futures.

Advancing water equity in California requires ongoing exploration to distributional equity, alongside the continuous refinement of modeling tools and policy frameworks. Only through such efforts can we begin to rectify past inequities and ensure that all communities and ecosystems, particularly those historically harmed, can thrive amidst climate change and water scarcity. The lessons from this chapter point to a future where water decisions are guided not just by technical efficiency, but also by fairness and shared prosperity.
