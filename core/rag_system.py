                2.  **Recognitional Equity:** How are these groups recognized, or ignored? Are their unique needs, histories, and perspectives acknowledged in the User Document?
                3.  **Procedural Equity:** Does the User Document describe fair and accessible processes for these groups to participate in decisions, raise concerns, or access benefits/mitigation?
                4.  **Distributional Equity:** How are resources, benefits, burdens, and risks distributed with respect to these vulnerable groups according to the User Document? Are there disproportionate negative impacts or unequal access to positive outcomes?

                7.  **Mitigation Strategies:** If mitigation strategies are discussed in the User Document, how effectively and equitably do they address the needs and reduce negative impacts on these vulnerable groups?
                8.  **Provide Evidence:** Cite specific examples or text snippets from the *User Document* (using file search citations if provided by the tool).
                9.  **Balanced View (within Vulnerable Group Focus):** Present both positive considerations for vulnerable groups and areas of concern found in the User Document.

                4.  **Recognitional Equity & Severity:** Does the User Document acknowledge the varying severities of impact on different groups? Are particularly severe impacts on marginalized communities recognized and prioritized?

                6.  **Structural Equity & Severity:** Do the identified severe impacts stem from or contribute to underlying structural inequities? Does the User Document propose structural changes to mitigate severe negative impacts or prevent future ones?

                4.  **Sufficiency:** Are the proposed mitigation strategies likely to be sufficient to address the scale and nature of the identified impacts/inequities?
                5.  **Provide Evidence:** Cite specific details about the mitigation strategies from the *User Document*.
                6.  **Balanced View:** Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed mitigation strategies in terms of their potential equity outcomes.

            3.  **Apply the Framework Critically:** For each relevant detail found in the User Document pertaining to the **User Query's subject**:
                *   Evaluate it against the definitions of the COEQWAL equity dimensions.
                *   Determine if it primarily exemplifies **positive alignment** (a strength/pro) **OR if it raises potential concerns, indicates a shortcoming, or represents potential inequity** (a weakness/con).
